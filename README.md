# Electronic-Python

Ever had the desire to make your programming interact with real objects? Apply a bit of electronics and Python and we have an unending 
vista of home projects.

A quick overview of electronics, Arduino flavour, followed by an overview of VPython v7. After that we can work with both these elements
for simple projects.

Create your own gauges to interact with Arduino, either in tkinter or PIL (Pillow).
