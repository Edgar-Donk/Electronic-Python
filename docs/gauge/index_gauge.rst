Common Gauge Terms
==================

The outer circle is the bezel or frame, the background with the ticks  
is the scale, the figures next to the scale are the scale label, the pointer 
is the mechanical device that shows the value whilst the circular device 
holding the pointer in place is the pointer cap. Sometimes a coloured region(s)
is used within the range.
