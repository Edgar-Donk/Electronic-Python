Using Python when Working with Arduino.
=======================================

.. topic:: Purpose

    Ever had the desire to make your programming interact with real objects?
    Apply a bit of electronics and Python and we have an unending vista of 
    home projects.

.. topic:: What to Expect

    A quick overview of electronics, Arduino flavour, followed by an overview
    of VPython v7. After that we can work with both these elements for simple
    projects.
